A quick introduction to setup the application. 

Clone the project into your own system, then:

```shell
git clone https://gitlab.com/treatspace/developer/front-end-engineer-evaluation.git
cd front-end-engineer-evaluation
npm install
```

Once you have all of the packages installed, remain in the root directory of the project and run `gulp`
